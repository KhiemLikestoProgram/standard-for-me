# standard-for-me
A standard (for me) class for writing code faster.

# About
This is a library for writing faster code. Any help will be good, thanks! (But no need to donate, I don't have a bank account yet)
Be calm, this is not a professional project. It can have very horrible code because I don't know how to properly refactor code yet.

Oh and if you are interested in my projects, then you can visit my website here: https://khiemlikestoprogram.github.io. It's kinda unfinished, and the website will **NEVER HAVE** user registration. I make this for fun, remember?

# About me
Go to https://github.com/KhiemLikestoProgram for more info.
I'm a Python programmer and also a C++ one but not active.

# How to install and run the program.
- Step 1: Install the specified version.
- Step 2: Open the terminal, then change to the directory where you put the program.
- Step 3: Run `python standard_for_me.py` or `.\kshell` or (`kshell` if you put the batch script in System32 [64-bit] or SysWOW64 [32-bit] folder).
Voila! You have done it in just three steps!
